Do not worry, your former profiles ARE NOT LOST.

You are not seeing them just because they were not
migrated (yet) to version 3.0.0. Downgrading the app
to the App Store version would restore them.

You may also notice that several features are missing,
but they will be gradually reintroduced before hitting
the App Store.

Anything else, please report to beta@passepartoutvpn.app
