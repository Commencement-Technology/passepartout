WARNING #1: you may lose some old profiles created
with the early betas, this is necessary now to avoid
bigger problems with the keychain after release.

WARNING #2: you will lose favorites and excluded
endpoints one last time, because the database had to
be moved around.

* Drop malformed keychain group
* Reword strings in "Purchased" view
* Unify paywall and eligibility (#1018)
* Reorganize Core Data containers (#1017)
